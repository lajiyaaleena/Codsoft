As part of the Machine learning internship at codsoft Iam sharing all the tasks allocated to me.


Task_1 - MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb. In this classification problem I have used Logistic Regression for movie genre classification.  With the two datasets training as well as testing data, the description for the movies were subjected to basic data cleaning such as punctuation removal, tokenization, removal of stop words, lemmatization and used TFIDF for feature extraction. Trained the Logistic Regression classifier on the preprocessed and TF-IDF transformed data. This algorithm is well-suited for text classification tasks and can handle multiple classes.Appropriate metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are used to evaluate the performance of the classifier. These metrics help assess how well the models are classifying the movie genres. Also predicted genres for the test data.

Task_2 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection.In this task, a decision tree model is built to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. After cleaning of data and removal of unwanted columns converted all categorical variables to numeric values. Train_df is used to train the model using decision tree classifier and tested using test_df. Appropriate metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are used to evaluate the performance of the classifier and determine how well the model performs.

Task_3 - CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction.In this task , random forest algorithm is used to create a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Then analysed the churn rate with respect to different attributes using different plots.Later build a model using Random Forest.Appropriate metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are used to evaluate the performance of the classifier and determine how well the model performs.
