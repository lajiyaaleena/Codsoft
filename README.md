As part of the Machine learning internship at codsoft Iam sharing all the tasks allocated to me
Task_1 - MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb. In this classification problem I have used Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models where logistic regression gave a  better accuracy. With the two datasets training as well as testing data, the description for the movies were subjected to basic data cleaning such as punctuation removal, tokenization, removal of stop words, lemmatization and used TFIDF for feature extraction.Later trained the Naive Bayes classifier using the preprocessed and TF-IDF transformed data. Since it provided a low accuracy Logistic regression was used and trained the Logistic Regression classifier on the preprocessed and TF-IDF transformed data. This algorithm is well-suited for text classification tasks and can handle multiple classes.Appropriate metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) are used to evaluate the performance of both classifiers. These metrics help assess how well the models are classifying the movie genres.
